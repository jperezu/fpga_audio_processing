2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
SYNTH-13#1 Warning
combinational multiplier  
Detected combinational multiplier in DSP instance SCND/fixed_point.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#1 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_clk_12M and clk_out1_clk_12M_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_clk_12M] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_clk_12M_1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#2 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_clk_12M_1 and clk_out1_clk_12M are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_clk_12M_1] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_clk_12M]
Related violations: <none>
